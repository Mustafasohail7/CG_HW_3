# Homework 3: Meshes and Transformations
# CS 440 Computer Graphics, Fall 2023
-----

# Purpose

This homework implements:
- loading a mesh from file
- applying transformations

# Background

For this homework, you should

- understand mesh file formats,
- know how to draw connected elements in WebGL,
- know how to build the matrices correspodning to common transformations,
- be able to add interactive elements to an HTML page and connect them to listeners, and
- be able to look up and implement file reading in JS.

# The Problem Set

The problem as well as your tasks are described are in `hw3.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Previous Feedback

Feedback from the previous set of students who attempted this assignment is summarized on the accompanying page on Canvas.

Taking that feedback into account, several steps have been taken this year:
- the PLY format has been introduced in class
- the scanning repository has been introduced in class
- setting up a local web server was covered in HW 2 so that loading a local mesh file is not a problem

# Submission

There are 3 parts to this assignment. Lack of submission of any part will result in a loss of marks.

## 3.1 Solving the Problem Set

Each problem specifies the names of the files to be submitted for it. Please make sure your submitted files have the indicated names. Any files in your GitHub repository with these names at the time of the deadline will be considered as your submission. As your submission will be graded by your peers, please do not include identifying information in it.

This is a __team submission__, i.e. a single submission per team. Your team has a single repository to which each of you will have access. Your team submission will be assigned a __Submission Score__ based on the correctness of the contained solutions.

Deadline: 2359h on Sun, 22 Oct

## 3.2 Feedback

You will provide feedback on your team and on the assignment by filling the feedback form which will be made available as _HW 3.2_ on the course page. This is due at the same time as the problem solutions.

This is an __individual submission__, i.e. each of you has to fill the form. Doing so contributes to your __Team Factor__ which is 1 by default and is penalized in case of non-submission of the form, dishonest feedback, or unequal contribution to the submission as reported by your buddies and/or the commit history on GitHub.

Deadline: 2359h on Sun, 22 Oct

## 3.3 Peer Review

Two submissions will be shared with you for review which you will evaluate according to the accompanying rubric. You will submit a filled copy of the rubric for each submission against _HW 3.3_ which will be made available on the course page.

This is an __individual submission__ on LMS and contributes to your individual __Review Factor__ which is 1 by default and penalized for non-submission.

Deadline: 2359h on Wed, 25 Oct

# Grading

Your submission will be peer-graded in a double-blind manner as per the criteria specified in the accompanying file, _hw3-review.xlsx_. The score thus earned will be your _Submission Score_.

Your individual score in this homework is the product of your Submission Score, Team Factor, and Review Factor.

# Discussion

This is a lengthy and potentially confusing assignment. There is a lot to take in and it may seem complicated and daunting. So do not be shy to reach out! In case of confusion or lack of clarity, do not hesitate to contact the course staff. We also encourage you to:

- discuss with your buddy,
- post in the discussion thread linked in the Assignment module on the course page on Canvas.
